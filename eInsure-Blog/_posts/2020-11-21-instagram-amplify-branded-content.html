<p>
Instagram has announced new updates that will help users create, share and amplify branded content across the platform. These features are in addition to tools like badges in Live and IGTV Ads, which serve the same purpose.
</p>

<p>
    To increase transparency and to help creators disclose their sponsors, Instagram will be launching Branded Content tag in Reels and will begin testing in Live in the coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
    Branded Content ads in stories will now have tappable elements like @mention, locations and hashtags. Instagram will also introduce features for businesses to promote branded content posts with product tags. With this, brands can get more value out of the content, enabling people to shop directly from creators.
