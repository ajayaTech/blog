    WhatsApp on Friday announced a three-month delay of a new privacy policy originally slated to go into effect on February 8th following widespread confusion over whether the new policy would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk">mandate data sharing with Facebook</a>. 
</p> 

<p>
    The update does not in fact affect data sharing with Facebook with regard to user chats or other profile information; WhatsApp has repeatedly clarified that its update addresses business chats in the event a user converses with a company’s customer service platform through WhatsApp.

    "We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts," the company wrote in a <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update">new blog post published today</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    Since 2016, WhatsApp has shared certain information with Facebook, including your phone number, unless you were one of the select few users who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/26/12655518/how-to-stop-whatsapp-sharing-phone-number-facebook">chose to opt out of data sharing while the option was still available that year</a>
</p>

<p>
    The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification">released a separate blog post this week</a> trying to clear up the confusion, and it included a chart that specifies what information is protected and not shared when someone uses WhatsApp.
