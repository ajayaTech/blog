<p>
    Here are three trends that are predicted to see massive attention in 2021 and beyond.

<h3>
    1. AI must become practical
</h3>

<p>
    Progress in AI has already reached a point where it can add significant value to practically any business.
</p>

<p>
    According to a <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/increasing-odds-of-success-in-digital-transformation?linkId=105971657">report</a> by Boston Consulting Group, more than 80% of companies plan to accelerate their digital transformation, but only 30% of digital transformations have met or exceeded their target value.
</p>

<p>
    Many AI projects are small scale — <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/global-survey-the-state-of-ai-in-2020">less than a quarter</a> of companies in McKinsey’s 2020 State of AI reported significant bottom-line impact.
</p>

<h3>
    2. Solutions become more autonomous with deep learning
</h3>

<p>
    Deep learning pioneer Dr. Geoffrey Hinton <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/03/1011616/ai-godfather-geoffrey-hinton-deep-learning-will-do-everything/">recently told MIT Technology Review</a> that deep learning will be able to do “everything” — i.e. replicate all human intelligence. 

</p>

<p>
    There is a step to full autonomy that we must first conquer: what Dr. Manuela Veloso at Carnegie Mellon calls symbiotic autonomy. With symbiotic autonomy, feedback and correction mechanisms are incorporated into the AI such that humans and machines pass information to each other fluidly.
</p>

<p>
    With deep learning, neural networks approximate complex mathematical functions with simpler ones, and the ability to consider a growing number of factors and make smarter decisions with fewer computing resources gives them the ability to become autonomous.
</p>


<h3>
    3. Promise of curing future pandemics will accelerate research in quantum computing
</h3>

<p>
    Quantum computers have the computational power to handle complex algorithms due to their abilities to process solutions in parallel, rather than sequentially.
</p>

<p>
    Let’s think of how this could affect development and delivery of vaccines.</p>

<p>
    First, during drug discovery, researchers must simulate a new molecule. This is tremendously challenging to do with today’s high-performance computers, but is a problem that lends itself to something at which quantum computers will eventually excel. 
</p>

<p>
    However, AI and quantum computing have even more to offer beyond creating the vaccine.
</p>

<p>
    Quantum machine learning is an extremely new field with so much promise, but breakthroughs are needed to make it catch investors’ attention.
