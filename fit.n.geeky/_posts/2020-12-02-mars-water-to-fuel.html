    For years human wondered if there was water on Mars, we now know that there is, in fact, water on Mars, but itâ€™s either frozen or salty beyond human use. Then we wondered if humans could ever live on Mars, and if yes, how will we survive on the barren planet?

<p>
    Scientists at Washington University in St. Louise have come up with a solution: turn the unpotable water on Mars into fuel and oxygen.</p>

<p>
    They have devised an electric system to break apart the salty water to its constituent molecules; oxygen and hydrogen. They are fairly certain that their experiment on Earth can survive the Martian environment with temperatures as low as -33 degrees Fahrenheit.
