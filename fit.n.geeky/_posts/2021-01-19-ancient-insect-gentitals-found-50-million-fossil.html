    The fossil assassin bug, described today in Papers in Palaeontology, has perked paleontological attention because the rare specimen has its genitals intact.
</p>

<p>
    Chipped out of 50 million-year-old rock, the bug is so exquisitely-preserved that it almost looks ready to crawl out of the stone. Even the colored bands along the insect’s legs and body are visible. And just like exceptional circumstances were needed for the fossil to form, a lucky break was also needed to piece together this Eocene insect’s story.

    The fossil assassin bug is named Aphelicophontes danjuddi in honor of Judd’s donation. What makes it truly special is that the genitals of this fossil bug can be seen in detail—a critical anatomical aspect that entomologists often use to distinguish assassin bugs from each other.
</p>

<p>
    In technical terms, says University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign entomologist and study co-author Daniel Swanson, the genital organ of the assassin bug is called a pygophore.
</p>

<p>
    “The word comes from two Ancient Greek roots that literally mean ‘rump’ and ‘something that carries,” Swanson says. The organ is a hardened anatomical cup that surrounds the genitals just like the bug’s exosekeleton surrounds the body. 
</p>

<p>
    Despite being about 50 million years old, Aphelicophontes danjuddi has genitals similar to assassin bugs today—the basic setup has remained the same since the Eocene, even as subtle differences distinguish one species from another.
</p>


<p>
    “This is definitely an example of exceptional preservation,” says University of Colorado Boulder paleontologist Dena Smith, who was not involved in the new study.
</p>

<p>
    To start with, assassin bugs are rare in the fossil record. Despite there being over 7,000 species of these familiar bugs alive today, only about 50 have ever been found as fossils.
</p>

<p>
    The entire animal down to its reproductive anatomy has been preserved. “Genitalia are important characteristics of insects that are often used to describe and define species,” Smith says, especially because they are so seldom seen in fossil assassin bugs.
