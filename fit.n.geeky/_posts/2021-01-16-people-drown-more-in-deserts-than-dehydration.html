<p>
    For most of us, death in a desert means death by dehydration, but little do most know that, in deserts, death by drowning is much more common than death by dehydration.
</p>

<p>
    Over one-third of the Earthâ€™s landscape is covered by deserts, and only 20% of it is covered by sand. The remaining 80% of deserts might be made up of rocks and pebbles, desert soil, oases, and even ice and snow (such as in Antarctica).

<p>
    Deserts are also full of venomous creatures in the form of snakes like rattlesnakes, Horned Desert vipers, Inland taipans, and sidewinders. Deserts are also home to lizards like Gila monster and Mexican bearded lizards, venomous scorpions, deadly spiders, and other potentially harmful animals. Bites from some of these animals can kill an adult human being in a matter of a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
    However, there is a much more lethal danger awaiting in the desert than all the above mentioned causes, and those are the dangers posed by quicksands, sand storms, and flash floods.
</p>

<h3>
    Quicksands
</h3>
<p>
    Quicksands occur in areas where the desert sand is saturated with water, thereby creating a semi-liquid state of water which often pulls people down into its lethal depths. 
</p>

<h3>
    Sand Storms
</h3>

<p>
    Sand storms in deserts can be horrendous, and these are responsible for killing large numbers of people and damaging huge areas of property. Many people become lost in the face of such storms or receive serious bruises from the flying sand and pebbles, and some even die by drowning in sand.
</p>

<h3>
    Flash Floods
</h3>

<p>
    Flash floods in deserts, caused by torrential rains high up on the mountains, are also a cause of numerous deaths by drowning. Without any sign, gushes of water flow down the dry river beds, engulfing all that comes in their paths.
