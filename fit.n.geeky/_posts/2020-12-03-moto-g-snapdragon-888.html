    Motorola is working on a Snapdragon 888-powered phone, but it may not the smartphone you would expect. Next year there will be a Moto G phone with a Snapdragon 800-series chipset. The G-series has been around for years and its focus has always been value-for-money.

    Motorola returned to the flagship field after a few years absence, not with a Moto X phone, but with the Edge+. So, you would have thought that an Edge+ 2 or something will be the first Motorola with the new chip. And that is definitely coming too.

    But a Moto G with a flagship chipset may shake up the market a bit – there has been a dearth of “flagship killer” style phone over the last couple of years.
