    A blob of warm air high in the atmosphere has pushed the polar vortex off its axis over the past week. In the coming days, it’s likely to split into pieces, with possible ripple effects on weather across the northern hemisphere.

    But don’t start stocking soup for a blizzard yet.

    The polar vortex is a cap of rotating air that’s usually centered on the North Pole. (There’s another vortex in the Southern Hemisphere.) It sits in the stratosphere, a high-altitude band of the atmosphere far above the wind, clouds, and precipitation we feel on the ground.
</p>

<p>
    As the pole goes dark and freezes in the fall, winds begin to swirl and rise from west to east to balance the temperature gap between low latitudes and the poles. 
</p>

<p>
    The vortex formed by that wind, which turns counterclockwise around the Pole, ends up much colder than the surrounding air.
</p>

<p>
    But high-altitude heat waves called “sudden stratospheric warming events” can disrupt the vortex.
</p>

<p>
    “Essentially that vortex is getting shoved off the Pole and into the mid-Atlantic,” says IBM meteorologist Michael Ventrice.
</p>

<p>
    But it’s hard to predict what the exact on-the-ground consequences might be. “This field of research is still in its infancy,” Ventrice says. “We’re just understanding now that these splits are important for prediction of [weather patterns] going out weeks.”
</p>

<p>
    This year, he thinks there will be “a little piece of the vortex that splits off and spins away.”
</p>

<p>
    A <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/99/1/bams-d-16-0259.1.xml">2018 paper</a> published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that weaker and more distorted polar vortices were linked to bursts of freezing weather, but that the physical connection between the two was still unclear.
</p>

<p>
    “We’re starting to see some hints in our weather prediction models that there could be a pretty big shift in the North Pacific... that typically results in more of a connection with the Arctic Circle where cold arctic air can come down into North America”
</p>

<p>
    The implications for larger climate trends are also unclear. There is still a debate over how a warming Arctic will impact the jet stream, which some researchers argue may slow down and become “wavier” as the planet warms. “The polar vortex is often considered a part of that mechanism,” Amy Butler, a research scientist at NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory.
