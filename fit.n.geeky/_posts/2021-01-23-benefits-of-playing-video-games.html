<p>
    You can now stop feeling guilty about playing video games.
</p>

<p>
    Playing video games (responsibly) actually has some serious health benefits.
</p>

<h3>
    Playing video games brings cognitive benefits
</h3>

<p>
    The  fall edition of The American Journal of Play, 2014 featured a very interesting article on how video games bring positive, long-term effects on some of the most important mental processes: memory and attention, perception, and even decision-making abilities.
</p>

<p>
    Researchers used two simple strategies to test this theory:
    <ul>
        <li>
        A correlational analyze – a comparison between two control groups;
        </li>

        <li>
        An experimental study – a series of experiments with measurements taken before and after exposure to video games.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>
    Playing video games makes you smarter 
</h3>

<p>
    The study I previously mentioned pointed that passion for these games can improve a series of mental attributes. Researchers are interested in these attributes individually, but psychologists associate these attributes, in general, with intelligence. So the more you work on such skills, the smarter you become.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, some other studies back up this theory as well. A group of British researchers, for instance, discovered that some particular types of video games could actually improve the brain flexibility of the player. For scientists, this so-called brain flexibility is nothing more than… “the cornerstone of human intelligence”.
</p>

<p>
    This new study was the work of the University College London and the Queen Mary University of London. Over 70 volunteers took part and the test was, again, rather simple. They divided the subjects into two groups and had them play a total amount of 40 hours. One group played The Sims and the other group played Starcraft. In the end, they were all tested and those who played Starcraft had significantly better results with the cognitive tasks, more accuracy, and higher speed.
</p>

<p>
    Researchers now still need to find out whether these improvements are permanent or temporary. Furthermore, since both tests involved video games, they also have to determine what exactly from Starcraft (that The Sims didn’t have) improved the abilities of the players.

<h3>
    Playing video games can make you better at your job 
</h3>

<p>
    Any kind of activity that requires visual acuity and precision in handling particular instruments can be improved through playing video games.
</p>

<p>
    This one is a study dating back since November 2012 and was conducted inside a medical university from Texas. It compared three different groups: high school game players, college gamers, and normal, medical residents. Those still in high school played about two hours a day; those in college about four hours a day; and the residents played every now and then. The best results belonged to those in high school.
</p>



<h3>
    Playing video games can make you more sociable 
</h3>

<p>
    Some people might think that over-playing video games will make you isolate yourself from your friends; become more sedentary; lose interest in more engaging and healthier activities. This is in fact, true. But, the keyword here is “over-playing”.
</p>

<p>
    If you’re reasonably enjoying this activity up to two hours a day or just a few hours a week, then you can get serious benefits without much if any downside:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Become part of a community of online players and transfer your virtual friendships into real ones – if you stay on chats or enter local groups of players from your neighborhood;
        </li>

        <li>
            Corrupt a friend or even your better half to play such games too and spend quality time together with this shared passion;
        </li>

        <li>
            Learn new discussion topics that you can approach with your friends when you go out;
        </li>

        <li>
            Become more interested in your computer and all the other gadgets you use to play – become a more technical person, save money to upgrade your system, work hard to achieve what you want, even if related to gaming;
        </li>

        <li>
            Could actually develop a passion that will allow you to make it a lifetime career – think you can become a video game scriptwriter, a video game tester, a level designer, a gameplay programmer and many more;
        </li>

        <li>
            Develop aptitudes that will let you become better at real-life activities, like playing a sport, reading more and faster, thinking and making connections much faster than everyone else around you.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
