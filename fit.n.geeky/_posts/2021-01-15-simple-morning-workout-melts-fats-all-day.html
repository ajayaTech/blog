    Any fitness is better than no fitness at all, and if your schedule only permits you to squeeze in your sweat sessions in the evenings, over your lunch break, or even at your desk while you're toiling away on deadline, that's fine—it's the best you can do. 
</p>

<p>
    But if you've got more flexibility, there's a mountain of evidence suggesting that you should move your exercise routine to the morning.

    According to a study published in the<em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-018-0299-3.epdf">International Journal of Obesity</a>,</em> participants who stuck to 30-minute workouts in the mornings made healthier lifestyle and food choices throughout their day.
</p>

<p>
    Another study, published in the <em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604526/">Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology</a>,</em> found that working out in the morning was best for regulating your blood sugar and protecting your body from diabetes.
</p>

<p>
    A study published in journal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4703705/">EBioMedicine</a> tracked the exercise habits of male participants who worked out at varying times of the day, and the researchers discovered that the 24-hour fat burn—or "fat oxidation"—was highest among the ones who did their exercise before breakfast.
</p>

<h3>An excellent 10-minute workout</h3>
<p>
    With that in mind, we've provided below an excellent 10-minute workout that is guaranteed to ignite your body's stress response, get you sweatin' hard and feeling the endorphin rush, elevate your body's fat-burning machinery, and keep it high all day long. 
</p>

<p>
    You'll then do a circuit of the following exercises for 30 seconds each—as many as you can perform. Break for ten to 30 seconds for rest after each circuit, depending on your fitness level.
