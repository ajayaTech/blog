    Telegram seems to be enjoying the backlash WhatsApp received after it updated its privacy policy earlier this week.

<p>
    The messaging service posted the classic two Spider-Man pointing at each other meme with Facebook and WhatsApp icons in place of the two superheroes on Twitter.
</p>

<p>
    It then continued to take jabs at WhatsApp and Telegram users chimes in as well. 
</p>

<p>
    This came after WhatsApp updated its privacy policy earlier this week which made data sharing with Facebook mandatory. 
</p>

<p>
    Earlier, WhatsApp users were provided with the option to choose not to have their WhatsApp account information shared with Facebook.
