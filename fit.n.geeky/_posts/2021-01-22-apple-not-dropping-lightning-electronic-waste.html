    Apple is on a permanent crusade against unnecessary ports, and it seems that next on the list is the iPhone's Lightning port.

    It many ways it makes a lot of sense for Apple to drop the Lightning port from the iPhone. To begin with, it's one extra component that has to be fitted. It takes up space in the iPhone, and it's a hole that allows water and other random schmoo to enter the iPhone.
</p>

<p>
    We can't imagine how many Lightning accessories are out there in the wild. Over the years we have handled many hundreds, and we have dozens on our desk and the shelves around us right now. Getting rid of the Lightning port would, overnight, create a massive amount of e-waste.
</p>

<h3>How do we know that Apple knows this?</h3>

<p>
    Because this time last year it used this exact reason as a defense against pressure from the European Commission to switch to USB-C. Apple claimed that switching from Lightning to USB-C would create an "unprecedented amount of electronic waste," and disrupt "hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers."
</p>

<h3>Possible alternatives</h3>
<p>
    It's possible that Apple might make some wireless dongle available that acts as a bridge, but who knows. The flipside of this is that since iPhones have a long life, Apple might argue that these accessories aren't going to end up being obsolete overnight. However, in my experience, while iPhones have a long lifespan, I don't see the same being true for accessories.

<p>
    And wireless charging can never be as efficient as a wire.
</p>

<p>
    I've also heard concerns from people about not being able to put iPhones into recovery mode without a Lightning port, and that would mean taking a trip to the Apple Store.
</p>

<p>
    That's indeed another concern. The flipside is that this would make the iPhone much more resistant to jailbreaking or the data being accessed without the user's consent.
