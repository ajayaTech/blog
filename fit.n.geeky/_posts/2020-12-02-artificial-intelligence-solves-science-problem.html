    For about 50 years, researchers have strived to predict how proteins achieve their three-dimensional structure, and it's not an easy problem to solve.

<p>
    Google’s Deepmind claims to have created an artificially intelligent program called “AlphaFold” that is able to solve those problems in a matter of days.
</p>

<p>
    The latest version of DeepMind’s AlphaFold, a deep-learning system that can accurately predict the structure of proteins to within the width of an atom, has cracked one of biology’s grand challenges. 
</p>

<p>
    In the experiment, DeepMind used a new deep learning architecture for AlphaFold that was able to interpret and compute the 'spatial graph' of 3D proteins, predicting the molecular structure underpinning their folded configuration.
