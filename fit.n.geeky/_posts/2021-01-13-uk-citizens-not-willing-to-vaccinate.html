    The nurse said the problem was occurring "all over London" and therefore probably right across the country.
</p>

<p>
Speaking to the MailOnline, the nurse said: "Loads of people are not keeping the appointments their GPs have made for them.
</p>

<p>
"The problem is the vaccine has to be given or it has to be thrown away.
</p>

<p>
"On Thursday night we had something like 45 people who were booked for jabs but didn't turn up and didn't let us or their GP know in advance."
