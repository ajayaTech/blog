<p>
    German scientists have restored the ability to walk in mice that had been paralyzed after a complete spinal cord injury.
</p>

<p>
    The team created a “designer” signaling protein and injected it into the animals’ brains, stimulating their nerve cells to regenerate and share the recipe to make the protein.

<p>
    Researchers from Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB) in Germany took a different path, aiming to repair the damaged axons with a protein they call hyper-interleukin-6 (hIL-6). As the name suggests, this is a synthetic version of a naturally occurring peptide, which has been tweaked to stimulate nerve cell regeneration.

    “This is a so-called designer cytokine, which means it doesn’t occur like this in nature and has to be produced using genetic engineering,” says Dietmar Fischer, an author of the study.

<p>
    As incredible as the results sound, it’s still obviously very early days for the research. The team says the next steps are to investigate in mice whether similar results can be achieved if the treatment is administered weeks after the injury, rather than immediately following.
