<p>
    Everyone wants the data on their phone to stay private, but there’s a reason Android and iOS come with a variety of security measures to prevent other people from accessing it.

<h3>Keep your lock screen secure</h3>

<p>
    Your phone’s lock screen is the first barrier against unauthorized access. Whether you use a PIN code or a biometric feature (like pressing down a fingerprint or showing a face, make sure you protect your handset with the most secure method.
</p>

<p>
    You can customize lock screen security on Android by going to Settings, choosing Security, and then Screen lock. 
</p>

<p>
    Meanwhile, from the Settings app on iOS, choose either Touch ID & Passcode or Face ID & Password depending on which biometric security method is built into your iPhone.
</p>

<h3>Avoid spyware</h3>
<p>
    Thanks to the security protocols in place on Android and iOS, it’s actually quite difficult for spying software to get on your phone without your knowledge.
</p>

<p>
    To succeed, someone would need to physically access your phone and install a monitoring app, or trick you into clicking on a link, opening a dodgy email attachment, or downloading something from outside your operating system’s official app store.
</p>

<p>
    You should see a warning if you do any of these things by mistake, but because it’s easy to disregard those little notifications, you should always be careful what you click on.
</p>

<h3>Watch what you’re sharing</h3>

<p>
    Apple and Google make it easy for you to share your location, photos, and calendars with other people—but only if you want to.
</p>

<h4>iPhone Users</h4>
<p>
    If you’re on an iPhone, head to the People tab in the Find My app to see who can see your location at all times, and to revoke access if necessary. 
</p>

<p>
    You can audit shared photo albums from the Shared Albums section of the Albums tab in Photos, and shared calendars from the Calendars screen in the Calendar app. 
</p>

<p>
    If you’re in a Family Sharing group that you no longer want to be a part of, open Settings, tap your name, and choose Leave Family.
</p>

<h4>Android Users</h4>

<p>
    Android handles location sharing with other people through Google Maps. Tap your avatar (top right), then Location sharing to check who can see your location, and to stop them, if necessary.
</p>

<p>
    You can check your shared photo albums in Google Photos by tapping the message bubble icon (top left), but you’ll need to open up Google Calendar on the web to edit shared calendars. Click the three dots next to any calendar in the column on the left, then Settings and sharing to see who can view your schedule.
</p>

<p>
    Regaring Google Families, no one in the family can see any personal files unless you specifically share them, but if you want to leave a family group, open up the Play Store app on Android. Then tap the menu button (top left), Account, Family, and View family members. If you tap the three dots (top right), you’ll find the Leave family group option.
</p>

<h3>Protecting your accounts</h3>

<p>
    The usual password rules apply: Don’t repeat credentials across multiple accounts and make sure they’re easy for you to remember while remaining impossible for anyone else to guess. This includes even those closest to you, so avoid names, birthdays, and pet names.
</p>

<p>
    Two-step authentication (2FA) is available on most digital accounts, so switch it on wherever you can. For Apple accounts, visit this page and click Edit next to Security; for Google accounts, go to Manage account, Security, and click on 2-Step Verification.
</p>

<p>
    As long as you have 2FA set up, any unwelcome visitor should be blocked from signing straight back into your account, even if they know your password. To be safe though, if you discover some sort of unauthorized access, we’d still recommend changing your password.
</p>

<h4>Password Manager</h4>

<p>
    Password managers are programs that store and manage your passwords across all your accounts. Password managers store your passwords in an encrypted database that can only be accessed through a master password.
</p>

<p>
    Benefits - Easy to use, secure passwords and convinience
</p>

<p>
    Risks - Easily targetable, putting your eggs in one basket and autofill becomes a big security risk
