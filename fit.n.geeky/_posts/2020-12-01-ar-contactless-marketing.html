    This year, all rounds in the two-month-long programme were conducted virtually to ensure the safety of students and all Samsung employees. The competition, spread over three months, invited participation of students from diverse domains such as BTech, Masters of Business Administration and Masters of Design.

<p>
    The Secret Society came up with Augmented Reality solutions such as an AR store where you can place things in your house virtually and see how it looks.

<p>
    One other solution they came up with included asking your phone to help you do something, like pointing it at your washing machine and it will tell you which buttons to press and provide more information.
