    Everyone’s always talking about traveling through time, but if you ask me the ultimate temporal vacation would be just to pause the clock for a bit. Who among us couldn’t use a five or six month break after 2020 before we commit to an entire new calendar year? It’s not you 2021; it’s us.

<p>
    But maybe our computers can.

    A pair of studies about quantum algorithms, from independent research teams, recently graced the <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv preprint</a>  servers. They’re both basically about the same thing: using clever algorithms to solve nonlinear differential equations.
</p>

<p>
    And if you squint at them through the lens of speculative science you may conclude, then you will find, that they’re a recipe for computers that can basically stop time in order to solve a problem requiring a near-immediate solution.

    Linear equations are the bread-and-butter of classical computing. We crunch numbers and use basic binary compute to determine what happens next in a linear pattern or sequence using classical algorithms. But <a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2017/REUPapers/Thomas.pdf">nonlinear differential equations </a> are tougher. They’re often too hard or entirely impractical for even the most powerful classical computer to solve.
</p>

<p>
    The hope is that one day quantum computers will break the difficulty barrier and make these hard-to-solve problems seem like ordinary compute tasks.
