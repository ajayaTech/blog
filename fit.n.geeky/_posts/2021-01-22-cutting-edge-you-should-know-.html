<p>
    You won’t find any brash proclamations about the scientific world in 2021 here. Instead, here’s our selection of the most interesting research to keep an eye out for in the year to come.
</p>

<h3>
    Viruses can save lives
</h3>

<p>
    Before the pandemic came to dominate our airwaves, one of the biggest threats to our collective health was antibiotic resistance. This is the process by which infectious bacteria, like MRSA, slowly but surely, become immune to our strongest medicines. The phenomenon wreaks havoc in hospitals where superbugs thrive on patients with compromised immune systems.
</p>

<p>
    The ultimate goal of phage therapy is to identify viruses that feed on superbugs and find a safe way to deliver them to a patient.
</p>

<p>
    In 2021, expect a number of ground-breaking studies to publish their results. This could be the beginning of the end of the superbug.
</p>

<h3>
    Tiny CubeSat swarms could be the future of space exploration
</h3>

<p>
    While there’s something to be said about seeing a giant starship take off, the next era of space exploration needn’t be big, brash and expensive.
</p>

<p>
    Around Europe there’s a wave of engineers and scientists aiming to miniaturise satellites so that hundreds can be sent into orbit and beyond with minimal cost and effort.
</p>

<h3>
    Rewilding could temper the climate crisis
</h3>

<p>
    Mass extinction and the climate crisis could be mitigated by the careful restoration of wild spaces, creating ecosystems that lock up carbon in the process. And as a bonus, these wildernesses could provide something of a safe haven for our beleaguered pollinators.
</p>

<p>
    Critics argue the money would be better spent protecting what wild spaces we have left and, of course, farmers are concerned that their way of life and indeed their livelihood could be under threat.
</p>

<h3>
    We’re going to see ancient history anew, thanks to shotgun paleoprotemics
</h3>

<figure class="figure">

<p>
    Paleoproteomics is essentially a new lens through which we can see the past. It’s the study of ancient proteins, which are more abundant and tend to hang around longer in ancient fossils than DNA.
</p>

<p>
    Thus far the technique has already provided insight into samples that are 3.4 million years old, whereas the oldest DNA fragment studied to date is 800,000 years old. This relatively new field is revealing more about the human origin story every day and there’s likely to be even more exciting breakthroughs from this field to pore over in 2021.
</p>

<h3>
    Cloning is going mainstream
</h3>

<p>
    When Dolly the sheep, the first animal clone, was born 25 years ago it was moment engulfed in controversy that consumed the news agenda for weeks. Today the cloning of animals seems to have become fairly unremarkable.
</p>

<p>
    The tech is also in use in breeding better working dogs, like drug-detection dogs, where the clones out-perform traditionally bred animals in training.
</p>

<h3>
    Playing in virtual worlds is a new frontier in mental health treatment
</h3>

<figure class="figure">

<p>
    Although virtual reality tech is at the point where it can be convincingly realistic and totally immersive, it hasn’t become mainstream yet. 
</p>

<p>
    The most salient example of how VR can be useful is perhaps in the treatment of phobias or anxiety disorders.
</p>

<h3>
    Cracks are appearing in our best models of the Universe
</h3>

<figure class="figure">

<p>
    For the most part, our understanding of the laws that govern the Universe is profound. Our model of the Universe means we can use GPS to follow any object on the planet, study worlds light-years away and look back to the birth of the cosmos with phenomenal accuracy and clarity. 
</p>

<p>
    It’s mind-blowing stuff, perhaps best left in the hands of radio astronomer Marcus Chown, who explains here why our understanding of the Universe doesn’t add up. But in the year ahead, we’re looking forward to seeing how work using gravitational waves to probe the Universe may provide answers, or at the very least patch up our current models.
