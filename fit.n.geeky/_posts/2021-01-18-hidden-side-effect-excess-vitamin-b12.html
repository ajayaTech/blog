    Vitamin B12 is an important nutrient that plays a vital role in maintaining bodily systems. It's used for red blood cell development, cell metabolism, to keep nerves healthy, and to create DNA.
</p>
<p>
    As with any nutrient though, too much can have drawbacks. Thankfully, the risk of that is very low with vitamin B12.

<p>
    We get vitamin B12 we need through our diet, as it's found in meat, fish, and dairy. But many people also take a vitamin B12 supplement, which is generally considered safe.
</p>

<p>
    Where an individual might run into problems is when they've been prescribed vitamin B12 injections by a doctor. These shots contain a much higher amount of the vitamin than over-the-counter supplements, and might come with side effects, according to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/vitamin-b12-side-effects#side-effects">Healthline</a>.

</p>

<h3>Side Effects</h3>
<p>
    If you've been prescribed vitamin B12 injections and experience diarrhea, itching, rash, headaches, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting, speak with your doctor. Occasionally, very serious side effects can occur, including pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure, blood clots in veins, swelling, or a rare blood cancer called polycythemia.

<h3>
    How much do we need everyday?
</h3>
<p>
    For most people, a recommended daily allowance of 2.4 micrograms per day is suggested, according to the National Institutes of Health. During pregnancy, that can be increased to 2.6 mcg and up to 2.8 mcg while breastfeeding.
