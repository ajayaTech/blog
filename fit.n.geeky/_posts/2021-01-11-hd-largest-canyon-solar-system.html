    This grandest canyon in the Solar System stretches 4,000 km (2,500 miles) across the Red Planet â€” nearly covering a quarter of the circumference of that ruddy world. Now, images released on Christmas Day, utilizing the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, show this mighty rift in stunning detail.

    More than five million years ago, the Grand Canyon in Arizona was slowly carved out by the flow of water in the Colorado River. But, despite the presence of large quantities of water on Mars in the ancient past, it is unlikely water was the primary cause responsible for the formation of its counterpart on Mars.
</p>

<p>
    Billions of years ago, the eruption of Martian volcanoes in the Tharsis region near the present-day canyon erupted, ripping the crust.
</p>

<p>
    This material then fell, forming the valley, researchers suggest. Over the ensuing eons, landslides and magma flows (together with water) may have helped shape the site we know today.
</p>

<p>
    The movement of magma would have resulted in a swelling of ground near the Tharsis region would have lifted the Martian crust, resulting in fractures in the ground. This would have allowed subsurface water to escape, growing the canyon.
