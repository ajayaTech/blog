<p>
    Improving your eyesight is something you can control through lifestyle habits, such as by eating healthily, exercising regularly, and using proper eye protection when exposed to the sun. It's important to stay on top of your eye health by getting regular eye exams, and if your vision suddenly changes or worsens, consult your eye doctor and have your eyes checked. This can not only make sure you catch any eye issues early but also give you peace of mind.

<h3>
    Role of Healthy Lifestyle
</h3>

<p>Adopting healthy lifestyle changes can be an easy way to address many vision problems. Recent research has shown that people who achieved improved cardiovascular health through a heart-healthy diet and exercise had lower odds of developing ocular diseases like age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy.
</p>

<h3>
    Eating a Healthy Diet
</h3>

<p>
    To ward off degenerative, potentially blinding conditions like glaucoma, your eyes need vitamins and nutrients. Antioxidant vitamins such as vitamins A, C, and E and the mineral zinc can help stop the progress of age-related macular degeneration, for example.
</p>

<p>Lutein and zeaxanthin are nutrients that you can find in green leafy vegetables as well as other food items like eggs.</p>

<p>
    Omega-3 fatty acids are crucial for visual development and for the eye's retinal functioning.
</p>

<p>
    You can find a lot of these crucial nutrients in common food items. Omega-3 fatty acids, for instance, are in walnuts, cold water fish, and flaxseed. Zinc can be found in shellfish and red meat. Some foods with vitamin A include cantaloupes, carrots, mangos, and sweet potatoes. Vitamin C can be found in brussels sprouts, broccoli, and oranges, while you'll find vitamin E in almonds, sunflower seeds, as well as peanut butter.
</p>

<h3>
    Getting Regular Exercise
</h3>

<p>Regular exercise is great for your overall health, particularly your eyes. People who engage in moderate exercise on a regular basis were 25% less likely to develop glaucoma in one study.</p>

<h3>
    Managing Health Conditions
</h3>

<p>Conditions that can affect eye health include:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Diabetes can cause diabetic retinopathy, which is serious because it can cause vision loss and blindness.
        </li>
        <li>
            High blood pressure, or hypertension can cause hypertensive retinopathy, which is blood vessel damage that can lead to blurry vision and even blindness. It can also cause choroidopathy, which refers to a fluid buildup under the retina, and optic neuropathy, a blockage of blood flow that can kill nerve cells and lead to vision loss. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Other chronic conditions that can affect your sight include high cholesterol, asthma, cancer, and even depression.  
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>
    Visiting Your Eye Doctor
</h3>

<p>If you find yourself experiencing sudden blurry vision or other changes in your eyesight, you should visit your optometrist or ophthalmologist for an eye exam to assess your vision. 
</p>

<h3>
    Using Eye Protection
</h3>

<p>
    It's important to do what you can to protect your eyes from harm. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun can greatly damage our eyes. It's believed that cataracts may be the result of years of sun damage.
</p>

<p>
    It's suggested that you find sunglasses that offer 100% UV protection, have lenses that are scratch-resistant, and are free of defects like bubbles that could actually impair your vision while wearing them. They should also have a large frame that covers most of the area around your eyes.
</p>

<h3>
    Resting Your Eyes
</h3>

<p>
    You should give your eyes a break now and then. Asthenopia, or eye strain, is when your eyes are sore, tired, or achy, especially after looking at a computer or phone screen for too long. This is from using the muscles that control your eye movements for a long time. 
</p>
<p> 
    You can try resting your eyes using the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet away, for at least 20 seconds. 
</p>
<h3>
    Quitting Smoking
</h3>

<p>
    Not only is smoking a dangerous risk factor for lung cancer and other illnesses, it can damage your vision. Smoking can make your eyes particularly scratchy, red, and stinging. It also increases a person's chance of developing cataracts.
</p>

<h3>
    Do Eye Exercises Work?
</h3>

<p>
    Eye exercises can alleviate discomfort or irritation, but they won't cure eye diseases or correct vision.
</p>

<p>
    Different kinds of vision therapy include:

    <ul>
        <li>
            Orthoptic vision therapy, which is a series of exercises carried out either weekly or over several months. These are to improve binocular function and are instructed at the office and done at home
        </li>
        <li>
            Behavioral/perceptual vision therapy are eye exercises to improve visual processing
        </li>
        <li>
            Vision therapy for prevention of myopia, or nearsightedness
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
