    In addition, key science experiments returns from the space station through NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for the first time since the retirement of the space shuttle, NASA said in a statement late on Friday.

<h3> Cardinal Heart - How gravity affects cardiovascular cells</h3>
<p>
    The space experiments include 'Cardinal Heart', which studies how changes in gravity affect cardiovascular cells at the cellular and tissue level using 3D engineered heart tissues, a type of tissue chip.
</p>

<h3> Space Organogenesis - Growth of 3D organ buds from human stem cells</h3>
<p>
    Another experiment is a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency study, 'Space Organogenesis', which demonstrates the growth of 3D organ buds from human stem cells in order to analyze changes in gene expression.
</p>

<p>
    Results from this investigation could show advantages of using microgravity for cutting-edge developments in regenerative medicine and may contribute to the establishment of technologies needed to create artificial organs, NASA said.

<h3>Rodent Research-23 - Changes in the retina before and after spaceflight</h3>
<p>
    'Rodent Research-23' involves the return of live mice. This experiment studies the function of arteries, veins, and lymphatic structures in the eye and changes in the retina before and after spaceflight.
</p>

<p>    
    The aim is to clarify whether these changes impair visual function. At least 40 per cent of astronauts experience vision impairment known as Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) on long-duration spaceflights, which could adversely affect mission success.
</p>

<p>
    "The large amount of science returning to Earth on this mission is possible thanks to upgrades to the SpaceX cargo Dragon spacecraft, which has double the powered locker capability of the company's previous capsules," NASA informed. On return, it can support up to 12 powered lockers, enabling transport of more cold cargo and power for additional payloads.
