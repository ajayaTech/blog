<p>
    Past nuclear and radiological accidents have shown that the mental health and psychosocial consequences of such events can outweigh the direct physical health impacts of radiation exposure. Both the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear accidents were reported to have considerable diverse and long-lasting social, psychological and mental health consequences affecting both individuals and societies as a whole. 
</p>

<p>
    The Framework is intended for officials and specialists involved in radiation emergency planning and risk management as well as mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) experts working in health emergencies.
