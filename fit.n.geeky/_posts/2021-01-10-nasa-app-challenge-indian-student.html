    A student of SunCity School, Gurugram (Haryana), he had teamed up with six high school students from the US. 
</p>

<p>
    The competition is a coding challenge in which NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) presents technical problems to high school students and seeks their contributions to deep space exploration missions. The six-member team developed an app using the cross-platform game engine Unity and programmed it in C#.
</p>

<p>
    The students took part in the Artemis Generation endeavours to land astronauts -- including the first woman and the next man -- on the Moon by 2024, as per the release.

<p>
    In this year's challenge, organised by NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Team, the participants were required to develop an app to visualise the Lunar South Pole to assist in mission planning and exploration activities.
