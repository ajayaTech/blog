<p>
    A white hole is a bizarre cosmic object which is intensely bright, and from which matter gushes rather than disappears.
</p>

<p>
    Unlike black holes, there’s no consensus about whether white holes exist, or how they’d be formed.

<h3>Einstein’s theory of gravity</h3>
<p>
    They are predicted by Einstein’s theory of gravity, and are most often mentioned in the context of `wormholes`.

<p>
    A black hole acts as the entry point to a tunnel through space and time, ending in a white hole somewhere else in the Universe.
</p>


<p>
    But this is deeply controversial, because Einstein’s theory predicts the existence of a so-called singularity at the centre of black holes – a state of infinite gravity which would prevent anything from passing through to the white hole on the other side.
</p>

<h3>Alternate thought</h3>
<p>
    Some theorists also think that a combination of Einstein’s theory and quantum theory points to a new way of thinking about white holes. 
</p>

<p>
    Instead of being the ‘exit’ from a wormhole, they may be a slow-motion replay of the formation of the original black hole.
</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>
    The process starts when an old massive star collapses under its own weight and forms a black hole .
</p>

<p>
    Then, the  quantum effects occurring around the surface of the black hole halt further collapse to a singularity, and instead begin to gradually turn the black hole into a white hole that’s spewing out the original star matter again.
</p>

<p>
    Just that, the process is so mind-bendingly slow, that, we may be in for a very long wait to find out if white holes really exist.
