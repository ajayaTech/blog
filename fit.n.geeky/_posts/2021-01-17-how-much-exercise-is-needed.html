<p>
    The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends adults get at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, around 36% of people overestimate their physical activity levels — and an even higher proportion (61%) of individuals that are not reaching adequate activity levels are overestimating their physical activity levels. One review even found people overestimate their activity levels anywhere from 36% to 173%.

<h3>Heart Range as a parameter</h3>
<p>
    Moderate-intensity exercise is considered to be any physical activity that requires a person to work at 40-59% of their heart rate reserve (the difference between resting heart rate and maximum heart rate). 
</p>

<p>
    Anything higher than 60% of your heart rate reserve is considered vigorous exercise. But while that sounds simple, everyone’s heart rate can be different at the same exercise intensity – affected by age, gender, and fitness levels.
</p>

<p>
    To calculate the target heart rate you need to achieve for the different exercise intensities, you first need to know your resting heart rate as well as your estimated maximum heart rate. 
</p>

<p>
    Your resting heart rate can be measured by counting how many times your heart beats per minute while at rest. For an average adult, a healthy resting heart rate can be anywhere between 60-100 beats per minute. 
</p>

<p>
    Your estimated heart rate maximum can be calculated by subtracting your age from 220. For example, someone who is 45 will have a heart rate maximum of around 175 beats per minute.
</p>

<h3>Step rate as a parameter</h3>
<p>
    A step rate of 100 steps per minute is recommended to achieve moderate intensity. More than 100 steps per minute is needed to achieve vigorous intensity.
