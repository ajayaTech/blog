    If you recently got a new iPhone after sitting out several generations -- or maybe just don’t fiddle around with your phone a lot -- you might be missing out on some easy ways to get more done, faster.
</p>

<p>
    The iPhone has a bunch of “hidden” menus that help you do things like search across apps, go back to the last screen, find widgets that show snapshots of certain information, or quickly turn your Wi-Fi off and on.

<h3>
    Reachability - How to reach the top of your iPhone screen without dropping your phone
</h3>

<p>
    Reachability is off by default, so do this to turn it on:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Open Settings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tap Accessibility.
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose Touch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toggle the Reachability option to on.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Now that it’s on, use it by quickly swiping down at the bottom edge of the screen.
</p>

<h3>
    How to use iPhone widgets
</h3>

<p>
    You can place little mini apps, called widgets, on your home screen. But there’s also a whole hidden section dedicated to widgets.
</p>

<p>   
    This is to the left of your home screen, so you access it by swiping right across your screen. You can customize it with any app that has widgets. I have a photo gallery in mine and an icon that shows the battery life left on my iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch. I also use it for a quick glance at my Apple Fitness rings, CNBC Trending news stories, and more.
</p>


<p>
    For the built-in Apple widgets, and a handful of others that have been custom-built, do this:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Swipe right across your home screen until you see the widget panel with a Search bar on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scroll down and tap the oval-shaped “Edit” button at the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hit the + button on the top-left.
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose the widget you want to add.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tap Add Widget.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>
    How to search everything on your iPhone at once
</h3>
<p>
    You can search through apps, the web, maps, dictionary, files and more all by using the iPhone’s universal search menu.
</p>

<p>
    You can bring this up by swiping down from the middle of your home screen. You’ll also see Siri suggestions for your most common actions.
</p>

<h3>
    How to switch apps quickly
</h3>

<p>
    You can quickly change apps or close them by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then holding until you feel a gentle vibration. Swipe right to move through apps. Tap an app to switch to it, or swipe up to close it.
</p>

<p>
    Here’s a little bonus trick: did you know you can switch between apps by also just swiping right or left across the bottom of the screen? Try it! Open an app and then swipe right across the bottom. It’ll go to the last app you had open. Swipe left to go back or keep swiping right to move between apps
</p>

<p>
    Here’s a second bonus: You can go back to the last screen in an app, like the previous webpage, by swiping right from the edge of the screen. The best way to try this is to open a website, go to another site, and then swipe right across the screen. You’ll be back where you started. If you swipe left from the right side of your phone, you’ll move forward again.
