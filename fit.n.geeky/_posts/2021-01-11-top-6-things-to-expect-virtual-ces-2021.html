<p>
    This will be a CES like no other, as we experience it remotely from across the globe on our own screens.

<h3>There will be less noise and more signal</h3>
<p>
    This year's virtual CES will feature around 2,000 vendors. For context, last year's show in Las Vegas had 4,500. This year will be a little different with less than half of the companies involved.
</p>

<h3>The pandemic bandwagon will get crowded</h3>
<p>
    Companies are going to be pitching a lot of tech to help people cope with COVID-19 fears, lockdown life and working and learning from home. In the health and smart home spaces, we're going to see high-tech masks, smart air purifiers, more hands-free devices, UV-C lights to kill germs and plenty more.

<h3> Transparent OLEDs will create buzz</h3>
<p>
    With more of us at home, binge-watching, TVs were in high demand. There's always a massive TV or a rollable TV or another impressive -- if gimmicky -- new screen technology that becomes the flashy showpiece of CES.
</p>

<p>
    This year it's likely to be LG's transparent OLED screens. These are going from 10% transparent to 40% transparent, which opens up new possibilities for lots of creative use cases.
</p>

<h3>The biggest gadget will take center stage</h3>
<p>
    Automakers have been using CES as a platform to talk about what they call the "digitization and electrification" of the car for over a decade now.
</p>

<p>
    Automakers are converting some of the industry's most iconic brands to EV, including the Mustang, Ford F-150 and Hummer. Tesla just reached its long-predicted half a million vehicles sold in 2020, a number long mocked and doubted by the auto industry. On Tuesday, Jan. 12, GM CEO Mary Barra will give the opening keynote address of CES and Chevy has already promised that new EV announcements are coming.
</p>
<h3>Samsung will loom larger than ever</h3>
<p>
    Samsung is flooding with new announcements across TVs, audio, computers, home appliances and quirky attention-getters like last year's Neon AI chatbots. 
</p>

<p>
    Samsung will continue to make the usual waves this year, but it has added more fuel to the fire by holding a Samsung Unpacked event -- ostensibly for its next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S21 
</p>
<h3>5G will be a big deal, again</h3>
<p>
    All three US carriers now have nationwide 5G coverage. Every phone-maker -- including and especially Apple -- is on board. The discussion will involve using 5G to close the digital divide, as well as to improve the experiences around telemedicine and remote learning and working.
