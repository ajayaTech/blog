    China's Chang'e-5 lunar vehicle has finished collecting samples of lunar rocks and soil ahead of schedule. 
    China launched a robotic spacecraft on November 24 to bring back rocks from the moon in the first bid by any country to retrieve samples since 1976.

<p>
    The robotic vehicle has stored the samples and will now dock with the orbiting Chang'e-5 for the return journey to Earth, the country's space agency said on Thursday.
</p>

<p>
    The sample collection was completed after 19 hours, the space agency said in its statement, without disclosing the total weight of the samples collected. Late on Tuesday, the Chang'e-5 spacecraft successfully deployed a pair of landing and ascending vehicles onto the moon's surface. The plan was to collect 2 kg (4.4 pounds) of samples. China had planned to collect the samples over a period of about two days, with the entire mission taking around 23 days.
</p>

<p>
    The ascending vehicle would lift off from the lunar surface with the samples, and dock with a module currently orbiting around the moon. The samples would then be transferred to a return capsule onboard the orbiting module for delivery back to Earth.
</p>

<p>
    If successful, the mission will make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples after the United States and the Soviet Union.
