<p>    
    Brave has just taken a step toward supporting a decentralized web by becoming the first browser to offer native integration with a peer-to-peer networking protocol that aims to fundamentally change how the internet works.
</p>

<p>
    The technology is called IPFS (which stands for InterPlanetary File System), a relatively obscure transport protocol that promises to improve on the dominant HTTP standard by making content faster to access and more resilient to failure and control.

<h3>Distributed Nodes</h3>
<p>
    While HTTP is designed for browsers to access information on central servers, IPFS accesses it on a network of distributed nodes.
</p>

<h3>Faster Speeds</h3>
<p>
    Benefits of the new approach include faster speeds because data can be distributed and stored closer to the people who are accessing it, as well as lower server costs for the original publisher of the content
</p>

<h3>Resistant to failure and censorship</h3>
<p>
    But perhaps most importantly, IPFS has the potential to make web content much more resilient to failures and resistant to censorship.
