<p>
    India's own 5G technology, TSDSI 5Gi, has completed the evaluation phase of ITU's International Mobile Telecommunications 2020 (IMT-2020) vision and now conforms with the stringent performance requirement, ITU said in a statement. Now, India's contribution within the 5G domain is now being accepted as the global 5G standard.

<h4>Where Does Vitamin D Occur Naturally?
</h4>
<p>
Vitamin D is found in certain foods, including oily fish, mushrooms, eggs, and foods that have been artificially supplemented to contain vitamin D, like milk. The body also produces its own vitamin D when exposed to sunlight.
</p>

<p>
    The other two technologies that have completed the evaluation phase are 3GPP 5G-SRIT and 3GPP 5G-RIT submitted by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

<h4>Why do we need 5G?
</h4>
<p>
    "5G will enable much faster data speeds, reliable connectivity and low latency to international mobile telecommunications (IMT) — all needed for our new global communications ecosystem of connected devices sending vast amounts of data via ultrafast broadband."
</p>

<p>
    Mario Maniewicz, Director of the ITU Radiocommunication Bureau, said: "The successful completion of the evaluation process and the release of this global standard is a significant milestone for the global telecommunication industry and its users. 5G technologies will further enrich the worldwide communications ecosystem, expand the range of innovative applications and support the burgeoning Internet of Things, including machine-to-machine communication."
