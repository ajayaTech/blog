    The search giant developed its own ‘music school’ for engineers working on its smart speaker to help them learn how to listen like an expert.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, Google’s experts say, listening to a good song has a lot in common with drinking a good wine.

<p>
    The key to Google’s sound school is teaching people to listen using a ‘sound wheel’ rather like the wheel often used by wine buffs to describe their favorite tipple.
</p>

<p>
    “You don’t have to be an audiophile to appreciate good sound, everyone has the ability and potential to understand what good sound is through practice,” Chris Chan, a smart speaker product manager at Google explained.
</p>

<h3>
    Don’t be fooled by loudness
</h3>

<p>
    One of the first lessons Google teaches its staff is that loudness is a good cheat - and not to be fooled by it when you’re listening.
</p>

<h3>All about that bass</h3>

<p>
    Bass is another important factor Google emphasizes, and the latest google Nest Audio has 50% more than Google home. 
</p>

<p>
    “Bass anchors the fidelity, it anchors the music and adds a layer of depth and emotion. Within bass there are negative attributes like boxy and boomy, and positive ones like bass strength and depth.”

<h3>The perfect smart speaker: Clean, clear and natural</h3>

<p>
    If your speaker, and the music you’re listening to, has them - then congratulations, you’ve reached audio nirvana.
</p>

<p>
    “Full means there is a balance between the lows, mids and highs,” said Chan.
</p>

<p>
    Clear means there is no distortion, and natural means we’ve kept the sound as the musician intended.
