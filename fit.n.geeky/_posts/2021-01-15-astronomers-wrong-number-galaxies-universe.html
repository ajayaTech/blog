    Can astronomers be so wrong about the number of galaxies in the universe? What if the universe is a little darker than expected, counting way less galaxy than previously estimated for years?

    It seems so, according to new data harvested by NASA's New Horizon spacecraft. Leaving the illuminated inner solar system is the best way to determine just how many galaxies may exist in the unseen distance â€“ which is exactly what New Horizons did.

<p>
    Indeed, a previous measurement by the Hubble Space Telescope suggested there were 2 trillion galaxies spread across the universe. But the latest discovery counts only hundreds of billions of galaxies instead.

    The new NASA mission estimated the number of galaxies to be half of what had previously been estimated for years, in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03052.pdf">new study</a> published in The Astrophysical Journal and presented Wednesday at the 237th meeting of the American Astronomical Society, this one virtual.
</p>

<p>
    NASA's New Horizons mission flew by Pluto, located four billion miles from Earth on the edge of our solar system, in both 2015 and 2019. It looked across the vastness of black space, the study said, as the spacecraft was at such a distance that the sky it surveyed was 10 times darker than the darkest sky observed by Hubble.
