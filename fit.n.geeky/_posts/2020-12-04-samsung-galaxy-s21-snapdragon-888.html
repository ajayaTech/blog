    Granted, the scores are not impressive on Geekbench 5.2.5, but that just means Samsung is likely still optimizing the software on this device.

    The Samsung Galaxy S21 series is expected to arrive much earlier this year than ever before: January. CAD renders of the Galaxy S21+ surfaced earlier this week (based on leaks from further ago) which showed us a familiar design with a new twist around the design of the camera array, which flows towards the power key on the side and looks beautiful.
