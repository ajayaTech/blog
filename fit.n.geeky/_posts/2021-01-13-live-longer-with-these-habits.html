    The life expectancy of an American baby born in 2018 is 78.7 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heart disease causes the most deaths in the United States, with cancer, accidents, chronic lung diseases, and stroke making up the remainder of the top five.
</p>

<p>
    Now, compare that to the year 1900, when babies born could expect, on average, to live about one-third fewer years, with average life expectancy being 47.3, CDC data tabulated by Carolina Demography detailed. Back then the top five leading causes were influenza and pneumonia, tuberculosis, gastrointestinal diseases, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease.

<h3>Elite athletes live longer, so taking your workouts seriously could help</h3>
<p>
    Men who have trained as elite athletes live longer than their brothers who have not undergone such rigorous physical training, according to a 2017 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
</p>

<p>
    The study authors surmised that the longevity of the elite athletes was probably most attributable to the fact that elite athletes, as part of their training regimen, had spent more years taking care of their health and being highly physically active (which has been proven to improve longevity). The elite athletes also tended to be nonsmokers. This makes sense given smokers die, on average, at least 10 years earlier than nonsmokers (via CDC).
</p>

<p>
    a 2020 study found that Olympian athletes were not more likely to live longer than their non-Olympian peers, and the study authors believe this may reflect the extreme rigor and stress of Olympic-level sports.
</p>

<h3>Walking regularly can help you to live a longer life</h3>
<p>
    The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.588204/full">study</a> that found Olympian athletes do not enjoy a longer lifespan than their non-Olympic brethren, taken along with a wealth of research proving that physical activity improves longevity, suggests there may be some ideal level of physical activity when it comes to helping humans live longer.
</p>

<p>
    The answer may be 8,000 steps per day, according to a 2020 study out of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the results of which were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</p>

<h3>Moderately restricting your calories is a science-backed way to live longer</h3>
<p>
    A <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(19)30151-2/fulltext">2019 study</a> found that two years of "moderate" calorie restriction significantly improved cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in adults not already dealing with obesity.
</p>

<h3>Eating at least five servings of fruits and veggies per day is a life-extending habit worth exploring</h3>
<p>
    In 2014, The BMJ published a meta-analysis of 16 existing clinical studies (comprising more than 833,000 people) addressing whether eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day could lower the risk of heart disease. It was revealed that people who ate at least five servings per day lowered their risk of dying from heart disease by 20 percent, compared with those who ate fewer than five servings per day.
</p>

<h3>Including nuts in your diet has been proven to support longevity</h3>
<p>
    A <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1307352">2013 study</a> published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at nut consumption in about 76,000 women and 42,000 men enrolled in a large-scale health data collection effort and found that those who ate nuts regularly were less likely to die of any cause during approximately 30 years of follow-up. The researchers noted that deaths from heart disease, cancer, and respiratory disease, in particular, were less likely with increased nut consumption.
</p>

<h3>Maintain good oral hygiene and you'll live longer</h3>
<p>
    A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/prd.12128">2016 study</a> published in the journal Periodontology 2000 found that the number of teeth you keep as you get older may also be a good predictor of how long you will live. 
</p>
<p>
    The study authors attributed the correlation between number of teeth and length of life to the fact that tooth loss often occurs coincident to circumstances associated with shorter lifespan, including chronic illness and the lifestyle choices that may make chronic disease more likely (via Dentistry Today).
</p>

<h3>Spending time in the sun could help you live to a ripe old age</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10985-sun-exposure--skin-cancer">Sunbathing increases your risk of skin cancer</a>, but a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26992108/">2016 study</a> published in the Journal of Internal Medicine may encourage you to still get some sunshine. The study kept track of 30,000 women for approximately 20 years, and the researchers eventually found those who spent more time in the sun tended to live longer and have less incidence of heart disease.
</p>

<h3>Teach yourself to cook and you'll potentially be cooking for a long time to come</h3>
<p>
    Cooking your own meals is associated with a longer life span, according to a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/cooking-frequency-may-enhance-survival-in-taiwanese-elderly/D3AC16340A7166FD2DF6E423283B4E2C">2011 study</a> out of Taiwan that was published in Public Health Nutrition, a Cambridge University journal.
</p>

<p>
    As part of the study, nearly 2,000 adults over the age of 65 were monitored for a 10-year period, and those who cooked most frequently were more likely to be alive at the end of the study. Those who cooked more frequently were also more likely to be non-drinkers and non-smokers who remained moderately active (with twice weekly walking or shopping excursions) and ate less meat and more vegetables. 
</p>

<h3>Gardening can extend your life in a variety of ways</h3>
<p>
    A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26992108/">2016 study</a> out of Sweden published in the Journal of Internal Medicine. That may contribute to higher levels of <a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/278463/youre-not-getting-enough-vitamin-d-if-this-happens-to-your-body/">vitamin D</a> in your body, which is associated with stronger bones, a healthier immune system, and a lower risk of many cancers.
</p>

<h3>Your furry friend beside you might be a key to living longer</h3>
<p>
    People who have a trusty canine companion have a better chance of living longer, according to a <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554">2019 study</a> published in the scientific journal, Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.
</p>

<p>
    One reason may be that dog owners have been found to have a reduced risk from cardiovascular events (and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm">heart disease is the number one killer in the U.S.</a>). And as demonstrated by a separate <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005342"></a>2019 study, dog owners also tend to have better outcomes when they do suffer a "major cardiovascular event," like a heart attack.
</p>

<h3>Reading is fundamental (to longevity)</h3>
<p>
    A study out of Yale published in the Journal of Social Science and Medicine in 2016, the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953616303689">study</a> followed 3,635 adults over 12 years and found that reading books contributed to a "23-month survival advantage" and an overall 20 percent reduction in risk of death from all causes.
</p>

<h3>Safe driving could help you live longer</h3>
<p>
    About 10,000 of annual accidents are speed-related vehicle crashes, David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), revealed in 2019, and many of them might have been preventable. "We can reduce this toll through effective, high-visibility enforcement and traffic engineering measures," Harkey explained. "Reasonable speed limits also have a crucial role to play, as our new study demonstrates."
</p>

<p>
    "Of the 37,133 people who died on U.S. roads in 2017," an estimated 5 percent would "still be alive if speed limits hadn't changed," IIHS explained.
</p>

<h3>Healthy relationships and a broad social network support living a longer life</h3>
<p>
    A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316&mod=article_inline">2010 study</a>published in PLOS Medicine confirmed what may have already been intuitive to many: The quality and quantity of one's social relationships is linked to life expectancy.
</p>

<p>
    The meta-analysis of 148 studies, consisting of over 300,000 participants, suggested that people with stronger social relationships were 50 percent less likely to die prematurely.
</p>

<p>
    A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763419308292?via%3Dihub">2020 study</a> demonstrated that social isolation is associated with higher levels of inflammation, which is associated with a number of life-threatening illnesses and conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as well as a reduced life expectancy.
</p>

<h3>Mental health matters in terms of longevity</h3>

<p>
    A 2011 paper by Thomas Insel, former director of the National Institutes of Mental Health, pointed out that Americans with major mental illness face a significantly shorter life expectancy — to the tune of 14 to 32 years fewer than the rest of the population. 
</p>

<p>
    But it's not just major mental illness that can interfere with your living the best and healthiest life possible. Even minor depression has been associated with a higher risk of death, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/205384">one study</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The takeaway here is to nurture your mental health as you would your physical health, including getting enough sleep, cultivating healthy relationships, and seeking support when you need it.
