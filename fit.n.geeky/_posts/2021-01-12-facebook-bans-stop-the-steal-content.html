    The company two months ago removed the original group of the same name, which fueled voter fraud misinformation after the election.

    The move is part of the company's protective efforts against violence and misinformation in the lead-up to the presidential inauguration after last week's events on Capitol Hill, Guy Rosen, the company's vice president of integrity, and Monika Bickert, its vice president of global policy management, wrote in a company blog post.
